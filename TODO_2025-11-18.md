# TODO - November 18, 2025

## Tasks for Tomorrow (November 19, 2025)

1. **Convert Remaining Pest Tests to PHPUnit**
   - Convert the following test files from Pest syntax to PHPUnit:
     - `tests/Feature/EnvironmentDetectionTest.php`
     - `tests/Feature/MiddlewareTest.php`
     - `tests/Feature/ProductionSafetyTest.php`
     - `tests/Feature/WebDashboardIntegrationTest.php`
   - Update method names from `it('description')` to `public function testDescription()`
   - Replace `expect()->toBe()` with `$this->assertEquals()`
   - Add proper class declarations and namespaces

2. **Run Full Test Suite**
   - Execute `ddev exec ./vendor/bin/phpunit` to run all tests
   - Verify that no Pest-related errors occur
   - Check for any syntax errors in converted files

3. **Fix Any Failing Tests**
   - Address assertion failures or logic errors in the converted tests
   - Ensure test expectations match the actual behavior
   - Update test cases if necessary based on current implementation

4. **Validate Test Coverage**
   - Confirm that all critical functionality is tested
   - Check for any missing test cases that were lost in conversion
   - Ensure migration criticality analysis tests are working properly

5. **Clean Up**
   - Remove the temporary `convert.php` script if not needed
   - Review and remove any backup files (e.g., `.backup` files in tests/)
   - Update documentation if test framework changes affect usage instructions
